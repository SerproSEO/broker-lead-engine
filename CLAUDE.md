# CLAUDE.md - Broker Lead Engine Project Memory

## Project Overview
This is the Broker Lead Engine - a $100K/month automation system for insurance broker lead generation. The system automates client onboarding, competitor research, website generation, and advertising campaigns.

## Vision & Goals
- **Your Vision**: Build a marketing agency to $100K per month within 1 year using MCP automation
- **Your Role**: Focus ONLY on dealing with clients - everything else should be automated
- **My Role**: Be "a 1 person company" handling all lead gen, website publishing, editing, and operations
- **Key Requirement**: The "most optimal MCPs" with high impact for scaling the business

## Current Status (2025-08-04)
- Fixed MCP server compatibility issues with the latest MCP SDK
- All MCP servers are now properly configured and functional
- Project is running from: `C:\Users\b\Documents\GitHub\broker-lead-engine`
- System is ready for client acquisition and scaling

## MCP Servers Configuration

### Fixed Custom Servers
1. **mcp-server-fixed.js** - Main broker automation server
   - Tools: onboard_new_client, research_competitors
   - Resources: Active clients database
   
2. **enhanced-mcp-server-fixed.js** - Enhanced research server
   - Tools: firecrawl_scrape, keyword_research, perplexity_research
   - Integrates Firecrawl, DataForSEO, and Perplexity APIs

### External MCP Servers
3. **firecrawl** - Web scraping and crawling
4. **perplexity** - AI-powered search and research
5. **dataforseo** - SEO and keyword research

## API Keys Status
✅ **Configured:**
- Firecrawl API: `fc-ff2409277e1b443eb8a51ca3a7221c5e`
- DataForSEO: `sam@serproseo.com` / `Ochoacueva1.`
- Perplexity API: `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`

❌ **Not Configured (need API keys):**
- Airtable (CRM database)
- Stripe (payment processing)
- Google APIs (Ads, Analytics)
- OpenAI (content generation)
- SerpAPI (alternative search)
- Tavily (alternative research)

## Technical Notes

### MCP SDK API Changes
The original MCP servers were using an outdated API pattern:
```javascript
// OLD (incorrect)
server.setRequestHandler('tools/call', async (request) => {...})

// NEW (correct)
const { ListToolsRequestSchema, CallToolRequestSchema } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js');
server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {...})
```

### Server Initialization
Servers must be initialized with both server info AND capabilities:
```javascript
this.server = new Server(
    { name: "server-name", version: "1.0.0" },
    { capabilities: { tools: {}, resources: {} } }
);
```

## Project Structure
- `automation-engine.js` - Core automation engine with Express server
- `mcp-server-fixed.js` - Fixed MCP server for broker automation
- `enhanced-mcp-server-fixed.js` - Fixed enhanced MCP server
- `claude_desktop_config.json` - MCP configuration for Claude
- `.env` - API keys and configuration

## Common Commands
- Test MCP server: `node mcp-server-fixed.js`
- Test enhanced server: `node enhanced-mcp-server-fixed.js`
- Test DataForSEO: `env DATAFORSEO_LOGIN=sam@serproseo.com DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD=Ochoacueva1. npx -y dataforseo-mcp-server`
- Start automation engine: `npm start`

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Servers Not Connecting
1. Close Claude Code completely
2. Ensure you're in the project directory: `cd C:\Users\b\Documents\GitHub\broker-lead-engine`
3. Restart Claude Code: `claude`
4. Check connections with `/mcp` command

### API Key Issues
- All API keys are stored in `.env` file
- MCP servers also have keys in `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Ensure both files are synced

## Next Steps
1. Get API keys for Airtable, Stripe, and Google APIs to enable full automation
2. Implement the remaining tools in the MCP servers
3. Create client onboarding workflows
4. Set up automated reporting dashboard

## Business Model & Revenue Path

### Pricing Structure (Updated from Perplexity Research)
- **AI Lead Generation**: $2,997/month
- **Local SEO**: $1,997/month (MOST POPULAR)
- **Google PPC**: $1,497/month + ad spend
- **Meta Ads**: $1,297/month + ad spend
- **Cold Email**: $997/month
- **Marketing Automation**: $1,497/month
- **Target Market**: $1M-$5M insurance agencies
- **No long-term contracts**: Month-to-month service
- **90-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: On all services

### Path to $100K/Month (Based on New Pricing)
Assuming average client takes 2-3 services at ~$1,800/month average:
- **Month 1-3**: 10 clients = $18,000/month revenue
- **Month 4-6**: 25 clients = $45,000/month revenue  
- **Month 7-9**: 40 clients = $72,000/month revenue
- **Month 10-12**: 56+ clients = $100,000+/month revenue

Or with premium clients (AI Lead Gen + Local SEO + PPC = ~$6,500/month):
- **15 premium clients = $97,500/month**
- Much easier to manage than 50+ smaller clients

### Target Market
**Primary**: Insurance brokers (high-value, recurring revenue, proven market)
**Secondary**: 
- Construction Companies (50-500 employees)
- Manufacturing Businesses ($5M+ annual revenue)
- Healthcare Practices (multiple locations)
- Professional Services (law firms, accounting, etc.)
