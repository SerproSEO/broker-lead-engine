## SCRIPT:

### **INTRO (0:00 - 1:00)**

**[Screen: Clean desktop, maybe your website visible]**

**"Hey, I'm Samuel Ochoa from SerproSEO, and I'm about to show you something that's going to blow your mind if you're an insurance broker struggling with lead generation.**

**Most agencies spend 24+ hours per week manually calling through business directories, converting maybe 2-3% of prospects, generating only 8-12 qualified leads per month.**

**What I'm about to show you is how I used AI automation to find and qualify 10 high-value insurance prospects in just 23 minutes. And I'm going to do it live, right now, on this screen.**

**By the end of this video, you'll see exactly how agencies are generating 50+ qualified leads per week while their teams focus on closing deals instead of hunting for prospects.**

**Let's dive in."**

### **SETUP EXPLANATION (1:00 - 2:30)**

**[Screen: Show browser, maybe Claude interface or terminal]**

**"Alright, so here's what we're working with. I've got an AI automation system set up using something called MCP - Model Context Protocol - which connects AI to web scraping tools.**

**What this means is I can tell the AI to go out, find businesses in specific industries and locations, extract their contact information, and automatically score them based on how likely they are to need insurance.**

**Today I'm targeting Brooklyn businesses - specifically looking for construction companies, restaurants, manufacturing, and logistics companies. These are high-value prospects that typically need comprehensive insurance coverage.**

**The system is going to:**
- **Number 1:** Scrape multiple business directories simultaneously
- **Number 2:** Extract company details, contact info, and size indicators  
- **Number 3:** Run each prospect through a qualification algorithm
- **Number 4:** Give me a prioritized list of hot leads ready for outreach

**Let's start the timer and see what happens."**

### **LIVE DEMO (2:30 - 8:00)**

**[Screen: Start screen recording of actual automation process]**

**"Okay, timer starts now. I'm telling the system to scrape Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, Yellow Pages business directory, and a few industry-specific sources.**

**[Type or show commands being executed]**

**"While this is running, let me explain what's happening behind the scenes. The AI is:**

**- Accessing business directory websites**
**- Finding company listings in our target industries**
**- Extracting names, addresses, phone numbers, websites**
**- Estimating company size based on employee counts and revenue indicators**
**- Checking for growth signals like recent expansions or new locations**

**[Show progress indicators or data being collected]**

**"Okay, first batch is coming in... I can see we've already found 47 businesses. Let me run these through the qualification system.**

**[Show qualification algorithm working]**

**"The scoring system works like this:**
**- Company size gets 30% weight - bigger companies need more coverage**
**- Industry risk gets 25% - construction and food service score higher**  
**- Growth signals get 20% - new businesses or expansions are hot prospects**
**- Contact quality gets 15% - direct decision maker contact is gold**
**- Geographic fit gets 10% - closer is better for relationship building**

**[Show results starting to populate]**

**"Beautiful! Look at this - we've got our first qualified prospect. This is a food processing company, estimated 85-120 employees, score of 95 out of 100. Based on industry benchmarks, they probably spend $45,000 to $75,000 annually on insurance premiums.**

**[Continue showing more results]**

**"Here's number two - transportation and logistics company, 45-65 employees, score of 88. These guys need commercial auto, cargo insurance, workers comp... probably $35,000 to $55,000 in annual premiums.**

**"And here's a catering business - 25-35 employees, high liability exposure, scored 83 points. Perfect prospect for general liability and product liability coverage.**

**[Show final results]**

**"Okay, and... done. 23 minutes on the timer.**

**Let me show you what we accomplished."**

### **RESULTS REVEAL (8:00 - 10:00)**

**[Screen: Show final results dashboard or spreadsheet]**

**"In exactly 23 minutes, the system:**

**âœ… Scraped 147 total businesses from multiple directories**
**âœ… Identified 47 businesses in our target industries**  
**âœ… Qualified 10 high-scoring prospects ready for outreach**
**âœ… Calculated over $200,000 in total annual premium potential**

**Here are the top 3 prospects:**

**ðŸ”¥ Food Processing Company - Score 95/100**
**- 85-120 employees**
**- $45K-$75K annual premium potential**
**- Needs: General liability, product liability, workers comp, cyber**

**ðŸ”¥ Logistics Company - Score 88/100**  
**- 45-65 employees**
**- $35K-$55K annual premium potential**
**- Needs: Commercial auto, cargo, workers comp, general liability**

**ðŸ”¥ Catering Business - Score 83/100**
**- 25-35 employees**  
**- $18K-$28K annual premium potential**
**- Needs: General liability, product liability, commercial auto**

**If I converted just these three prospects at a 15% close rate and 15% commission, that's potentially $6,750 to $12,750 in commission revenue.**

**From 23 minutes of automated work.**

**Most brokers take 2-3 months to find prospects this qualified through manual prospecting."**
